🚀 DevOps Roadmap Progress
AWS CLI • Shell Scripting • Git & GitHub

This repository documents my hands-on DevOps learning journey, focusing on real-world tooling, best practices, and problem-solving rather than theory alone.

🔐 AWS CLI & Cloud Authentication

Configured IAM Role–based authentication for AWS CLI on an EC2 instance.

Understood why browser-based authentication is unsuitable for headless/server environments.

Verified AWS identity and permissions using STS.

Followed AWS security best practices by avoiding hardcoded access keys.

Outcome:
Secure, production-style AWS CLI access suitable for automation.

🐚 Shell Scripting for AWS Automation

Built Bash scripts to automate AWS resource exploration.

Executed AWS CLI commands programmatically to inspect:

Configured AWS region

S3 buckets (storage layer)

EC2 instances and their states (compute layer)

Availability Zones

IAM roles (access management)

Improved script clarity using structured output and comments.

Outcome:
Practical understanding of how shell scripting is used in DevOps to interact with cloud infrastructure.

🌱 Git & Version Control (CLI-Driven)

Managed repositories entirely using the Git command line.

Practiced the full Git lifecycle:

working directory → staging → commit → remote push


Used git diff to review changes before committing.

Correctly tracked file additions, updates, and deletions.

Gained clarity on how Git records history vs filesystem changes.

Outcome:
Confidence working with Git in real DevOps workflows.

🔗 GitHub Integration & Repository Management

Authenticated GitHub CLI operations using Personal Access Tokens (PATs).

Resolved common Git/GitHub issues:

Remote already exists

Push rejected (fetch first)

README and file sync mismatches

Repointed local repositories to existing GitHub repos safely.

Maintained clean commit history and readable documentation.

Outcome:
End-to-end control of code from local development to GitHub.

🧠 Key DevOps Takeaways

Secure access management is foundational to automation.

Shell scripting is a core DevOps skill, not optional.

Version control discipline matters as much as code.

Real DevOps learning happens through debugging and fixing, not copy-paste setups.

✅ Overall Progress

Strengthened core DevOps foundations by integrating Linux, Bash, AWS CLI, IAM security, and GitHub workflows in a real, hands-on environment.
